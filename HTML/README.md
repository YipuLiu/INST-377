# Brief Intro
## HTML and CSS
Hyper-text markup language / cascading style sheets

Updated recently so they can do cooler stuff (e.g., HTML includes more semantic markup; you can run animations out of CSS)

- HTML structures the content (where does the header go, what happens when the user clicks here)
- CSS styles it (fonts, colors, etc.)
- jQuery / Javascript to add interactivity (the bells and whistles)

## Just a review
1. The HTML document includes a link to the CSS file
1. The CSS file can include links to other CSS files 
1. Most HTML tags wrap the thing they are affecting. So, if you want to make a line "header 1", you put `<h1>` at the beginning and `</h1>` at the end.
