# Brief Intro
## HTML and CSS
Hyper-text markup language / cascading style sheets

Updated recently so they can do cooler stuff (e.g., HTML includes more semantic markup; you can run animations out of CSS)

- HTML structures the content (where does the header go, what happens when the user clicks here)
- CSS styles it (fonts, colors, etc.)
- jQuery / Javascript to add interactivity (the bells and whistles)

## Just a review | the things you already know
1. The HTML document includes a link to the CSS file
1. The CSS file can include links to other CSS files 
1. Most HTML tags wrap the thing they are affecting. So, if you want to make a line "header 1", you put `<h1>` at the beginning and `</h1>` at the end. 
## Your mission 
1. Set up a repository as your website. Instructions are here: https://pages.github.com/ For now, just make a page called index.html.
1. Clone the repository to your desk top.
1. In your index file, create a header 1 (try "Hello World" for grins, or get creative) line and a header 2 line. Add two paragraphs (use lorem ipsum or copy from somewhere else {try bacon ipsum for grins}). 
1. Attach a CSS style sheet to the page. The syntax looks like this: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main-php.css">`. To start, attach the stylesheet you'll find here: https://faculty.umd.edu/css/main-php.css
